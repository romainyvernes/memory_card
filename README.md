## Memory Card
### Description
Test your memory with this movie-themed card game. Can you avoid clicking twice on the same card?
### Instructions
A set of 15 cards is laid out in a random order. Every time a card is clicked, all the cards get reshuffled and the player must select another card they haven't already picked. Should the player click twice on the same card at any point, their score is reset. The highest streak is recorded and the goal is to achieve a perfect streak of 15.
